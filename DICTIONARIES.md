# Dictionaries used and not used by Diffle.

Currently utilized dictionaries by diffle-lang are included in `/resources/[lang]/[dictionaryDir]`.

Each directory features 🧾 `LICENSE`, 🧾 `README.md`, and 🧾 `dictionary.txt` with a wordlist. The dictionaries I consider the best are there. If you simply want to grab a dictionary go to there (the source is worth checking because they may have updated the dictionary, license, or have added new words).

**I am very grateful to all the creators of open online dictionaries. Your help is invaluable. 💗**

## Open-source dictionaries

📔 - **Spellchecker**: the broadest dictionary, with the goal of encompassing as many words as possible and ensuring their accuracy. However, some inappropriate words may be incorrectly recognized.

🎯 - **Winning Dictionary**: a more concise selection, significantly smaller. Words that align with the spellchecker dictionary should function exceptionally well as winning choices in a spelling game (no weird endings).

🃏 - **No license**: Rejected because it doesn't have a license.

📄 - **Too little**: Rejected because it is too tiny.

### German 🇩🇪
The current German spellchecker is based on words from Wikipedia articles (likely gathered before 2018). It works okay, but the words may be too specific.
