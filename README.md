# Cool features

## Spellchecker API
This project is 100% GitHub-hosted, so it doesn't have a backend server. The spellchecker dictionary is usually over 45MB. In this repository, the dictionary is divided into thousands of JSON files. When someone searches for "Å‚Ã³dÅº," the word is converted to "lodz," limited to 3 characters, and pl/chunk-lod.json is fetched to check if it's there. It's a lightweight, quick, and serverless-like solution.

## A reactive keyboard
I challenge you to find a better keyboard in any Wordle game. This keyboard reacts and provides hints while typing, with optional vibrations (which are longer when an incorrect letter is typed).

## Spoiler-Free sharing
You can share your result with a hashed URL, which after winning your daily game, will display the words from the result.
