# Cool features

## Spellchecker API
This project is 100% GitHub-hosted, so it doesn't have a backend server. The spellchecker dictionary is usually over 45MB. In this repository, this dictionary is cut into thousands of JSON files. If someone looks for "Å‚Ã³dÅº," the word is converted to "lodz", limited to 3 characters, and pl/chunk-lod.json is fetched to check if it's there. It's a light, quick, and faux serverless solution.

## A reactive keyboard
I challenge you to find a better keyboard in any Wordle game. This keyboard reacts and provides hints while typing, with optional vibrations (which are longer when an incorrect letter is typed).

## A spoilers free share
You can share your result with a hashed URL which, after winning your daily game, will display the words from the result.
