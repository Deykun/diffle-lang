Hey, here is a translation file used to generate the translations in thic catalog. If you have a single or few string to fix, you can create an issue or a pull request on GitHub.

If you want to add completely new translations or improve them globally, you can create a copy of the table, match it, and then send me the file at szymon@tondow.ski. I believe it is easier to translate it that way.
